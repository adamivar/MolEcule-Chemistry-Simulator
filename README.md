The "MolEcule Chemistry Simulator" is a Python Pygame Chemistry Simulator that allows you to simulate the reactions between different elements and molecules. You can spawn in a mol (or more) of any basic element from the periodic table and see how it reacts with other elements.

The simulator uses a matching recipe to determine whether the elements or molecules can bond with each other, and bonding only occurs if the temperature conditions are right. You can also change the states of the molecules by changing the temperature.

Please note that the pressure is set at a constant 1 atm and cannot be changed to reduce complexity. There is also limited documentaion online for several reactions for any other pressure other than 1 atm. This is true for temperature as well, however temperature is crucial for many reactions to occur at all, so it was important to include. This also gives a way to somewhat "pause" the simulator by lowering the temperature to absolute 0k.

Features:
Simulates chemical reactions between different elements and molecules
Learn about the basic reactions and the temperatures at which they occur

Molar volume is represented by the size of each dot
Chemical formula ir represented by the text on each dot
Basic element color is represented by the CPK standard for that element
Compound color is represented by their color at STP
Gases are represented by a clear dot with a solid outer ring
Liquids are represented by a solid colored dot with a ring around it
Solids are represented by a solid colored dot with NO ring around it

How to use:
To spawn a mol of an element, click the left mouse button.
To add more to that dot, hold the mouse button down.
To switch to a new element, right-click. The elements are in order of atomic number.
To change the temperature, click the slider in the top left corner to move it. Temperature is displayed in 3 different units.

Purpose:
The "MolEcule Chemistry Simulator" is designed to be a fun toy/tool to help people interested in chemistry understand basic reactions and the temperatures at which those reactions need to occur. It can be used to explore and experiment with different chemical reactions and to learn about molar volume and the properties of different states of matter.
